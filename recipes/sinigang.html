    <h2>Sinigang na Baboy is the ultimate comfort food! Made with pork ribs, vegetables, and 
        tamarind-flavored broth, it's hearty and delicious on its own or served with steamed rice.</h2>
    <p>Sinigang is a classic Filipino soup characterized by its sour and savory medley of flavors. 
        It's popular comfort food in the Philippines,  usually served on its own or paired with steamed
        rice on rainy days to ward off the cold.

        Like adobo, the term sinigang describes a cooking method more than a particular dish, as it has 
        many variations. It can be made with protein such as pork, fish, shrimp, beef, and chicken and 
        souring agents such as tamarind, guava, green mango, calamansi, kamias, batuan, santol, and other native fruits.</p>

        <li>2 large tomatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>6 pieces gabi, (peeled and halved depending on size)</li>
        <li>1 6-inch radish (labanos), peeled and sliced to ½-inch thick half-rounds</li>
        <li>2 finger chilies (siling haba)</li>
        <li>½ bunch long beans (sitaw), ends trimmed and cut into 3-inch lengths</li>

        <li>6 pieces okra, ends trimmed</li>
        <li>15 pieces large tamarind or 1 ½ (1.41 ounces each) packages tamarind base powder</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 bunch bok choy or pechay, ends trimmed and separated into leaves</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse pork ribs and drain well.</li>
        <li>In a pot over medium heat, combine pork and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, 
            skimming scum that accumulates on top.</li>
        <li>Once broth clears, add tomatoes, onion, and fish sauce. Lower heat and simmer 
            for about 1 to 1 ½ hours or until meat is tender, adding more water as 
            necessary to maintain about 8 cups.</li>
        <li>Add gabi and cook for about 4 to 6 minutes or until tender.</li>
        <li>Add chili peppers and radish. Continue to simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add long beans. Continue to cook for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add eggplant and okra and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>If using packaged tamarind base, add to the pot and stir until completely dissolved.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Add bok choy and continue to cook for about 1 minute. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
